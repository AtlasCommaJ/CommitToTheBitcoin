## Hello, World!
#### EVE:   
Hello world  
Hey, have you been growing?  
Just like me you're a little less green  

Hey there lamppost   
Whatcha knowin  
Ssh! I'm a shadow, don't go telling where I've been  

So lights off me!  
I'm the hole in the wall now,  
Don't want to be seen, Eve's dropping by for a spell   
I want to hear about you, guy!  
My heart—well it bleeds, see?    
Start unraveling that song I know you're dying to tell  

#### MALLORY:   
Hello world  
You just keep getting simpler  
Less time to run means you're quick to corrupt   

Hello little town  
I like what you've assembled   
But I'll learn your tics and—tock!—your time'll be up  

So lights on me!  
I'm the whole of it all now,   
Hot on the scene, swapping heaven for hell  
Come step up and buy,  
Forgive us if we're greedy  
We've been traveling so long and now we're dying to sell  

#### BOTH TOGETHER:  
Hello world  
Key pairs can't beat this Queen pair  
We're racing to go, we're braced and we're curled   
You can't imagine the byzantine affair  
Created by a couple of girls
